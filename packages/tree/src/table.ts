/**
 * Transforms a given tree structure into a table format suitable for
 * rendering. It specifically targets nodes segmented by certain criteria
 * and displays their values at two distinct dates.
 *
 * The function accepts a `Tree` object, representing a graph of nodes
 * connected by various types of edges. The output is a table structure
 * (represented by `YourTableTypeOrInterfaceOrFunctionEtc`) designed for tabular
 * data display.
 *
 * The generated table focuses on nodes with at least one incoming
 * segmentation edge. For each of these nodes, the table includes columns
 * for:
 * - The values at two specific dates, for temporal comparison.
 * - The segment definition, providing data context.
 * - Values of nodes connected by an arithmetic edge, showing operational
 *   relationships.
 *
 * @param tree The `Tree` object with the data to transform into a table.
 * @returns A `YourTableTypeOrInterfaceOrFunctionEtc` table structure detailing segmented
 *          nodes, their data at two dates, segmentation definitions, and
 *          arithmetic connections.
